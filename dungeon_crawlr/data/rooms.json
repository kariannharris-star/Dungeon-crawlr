In its depths, you can see the ruins of a structure - perhaps a temple, now drowned. Strange lights flicker in its windows.\n\nA narrow stone walkway extends along the cavern wall, leading to what appears to be a small island in the center of the lake. Something glitters there.\n\nThe water is too still. Too quiet. You get the distinct feeling something massive sleeps beneath the surface, and one wrong move could wake it.",
